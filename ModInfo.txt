SRAirNetUpgrade Mod makes the Corral Air Net indestructable.
Flying Phosphor Slimes, exploding Boom Slimes, and even terrifying 
Tarrs cannot break the ceiling. That being said, you may find a
slime occasionally glitches through while you interact with it,
just like the Corral walls. Food and Plorts can also be forced
through; such as when a Boom Slime "booms" or a Dervish Slime
swirls.
